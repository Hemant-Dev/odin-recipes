<h2>Steps: </h2>
<ol>
    <li>In a large skillet, brown the ground beef and Italian sausage over medium-high heat. Add chopped onion and minced garlic, and cook until the meat is no longer pink and the onion is tender. Drain any excess fat.</li>
    <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper. Simmer for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
    <li>In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, 2 cups of mozzarella cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, chopped parsley, and beaten egg. Mix well.</li>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
    <li>Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place three cooked lasagna noodles on top.</li>
    <li>Spread one-third of the cheese mixture over the noodles. Repeat the layers, ending with the meat sauce on top.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese over the top.</li>
    <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until the lasagna is hot and bubbly, and the cheese is melted and lightly browned.</li>
    <li>Let the lasagna rest for about 15 minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy your delicious homemade classic lasagna!</li>
