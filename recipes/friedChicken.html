<h2>Ingredients: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 bone-in, skin-on chicken pieces (such as thighs and drumsticks)</li>
        <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the chicken pieces in a large bowl and cover them with buttermilk. Let them marinate for at least 1 hour (or overnight in the refrigerator) to tenderize the chicken.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix the flour, paprika, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper. This is your seasoned flour mixture.</li>
        <li>Heat about 2 inches of vegetable oil in a deep skillet or frying pan over medium-high heat to 350째F (175째C).</li>
        <li>Remove each piece of chicken from the buttermilk, allowing excess liquid to drip off.</li>
        <li>Dredge each piece of chicken in the seasoned flour mixture, making sure it's evenly coated. Press the flour mixture onto the chicken to create a good crust.</li>
        <li>Carefully place the coated chicken pieces into the hot oil, skin side down. Cook for about 12-15 minutes, turning occasionally, until the chicken is golden brown and crispy and the internal temperature reaches 165째F (74째C).</li>
        <li>Remove the fried chicken from the oil and place it on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy your delicious homemade fried chicken!</li>
